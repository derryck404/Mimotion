## ⌛Update
- Click **`Sync fork`** on the repository interface, click **`Update branch`** and wait for synchronization to complete.
- Back up the **Code[`encrypted_tokens.data`](https://github.com/derryck404/Mimotion/blob/master/encrypted_tokens.data)** in advance when **`AES_KEY`** is configured. Resubmit it to the repository after the update is completed.



## 🔔Notes
- This Github Action run six times a day, which controlled by **`cron`** in **Code [run.yml](https://github.com/derryck404/Mimotion/blob/master/.github/workflows/run.yml)**. The variable `minute` is random values.
- Please be sure to match the username and password of multiple accounts, otherwise it will not work.  
- The start time must be **UTC Time**.  
- If Alipay has not updated the step count, please go to **ZeppLife ---> Settings ---> Account ---> Delete Account ---> Clear Datas**, then log in again and rebind the third party authentication.  
- ZeppLife will not update the step count, only the associated ones will be synchronized.  
- Please note that the account is **ZeppLife account**.  
- The maximum and minimum steps increase over time and reach their maximum value at 22:00 Beijing time. To change this range, modify **`MIN_STEP`** and **`MAX_STEP`** in **Code [run.yml](https://github.com/derryck404/Mimotion/blob/main/.github/workflows/run.yml)**.
- The execution of **`Cron`** is queued according to the resources of GitHub actions, and it is not 100% run at the specified time.


## 🔍View Logs
- Go to [Actions](../../actions) to view the execution history of all workflows.
  - **`Random Cron #5: Scheduled`** indicates a scheduled task, while **`Random Cron #4: Manually run by xxx`** indicates a manual trigger.
- Click a record to view the execution details. Here, we use **`Steps`** as an example:
  - In the **`Jobs`** section of the details interface, you can see a **`build`**. Click it to view the execution steps.
  - Among the execution steps, focus on **`Start`**. Click it to expand the details.
  - Expanding this step will display the execution log. If the execution is successful, the current random step count for each account will be displayed.
  - If the execution fails, analyze the specific cause of the failure.
